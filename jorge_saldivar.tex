{\bf Thesis:} \emph{Improving cooperative and competitive behaviors on visually impaired children}. 

\end{topic}

\section{Professional Experience}

\begin{topic}

\item[July 2014 - October 2014] \emph{Visiting Scholar} - University of California, Berkeley. Center for Information Technology Research in Interest of the Society (CITRIS), Berkeley, California, USA.

Modeled, designed, and implemented a civic-participation tool for supporting the execution of public consultants, idea campaigns, and opinion polls directly in hashtag-supported social networking sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus. The tool was deployed as an extension of the platform CAFE used in the project California Report Card to engage citizens of California in the collective assessment of timely issues.

\textbf{Platform}: Web.

\textbf{Technologies}: Python, Django.

\item[October 2013 - December 2013] \emph{Visiting Researcher} - Information Analysis Division Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, California, USA.

Modeled, designed and implemented an web-based analytic tool for conducting real-time visualization of query execution. It converts a textual query execution plan to a tree visualization and as query executes, its tree visualization is annotated with live query execution events as for example, progress and live statistics for each query operator, overall query progress, etc. Also developed a recommendation plugin that annotates the query tree with the most interesting results of its execution analysis, which may indicate execution problems and recommend design solutions for problem queries.

\textbf{Platform}: Web.

\textbf{Technologies}: Javascript, JQuery, Java.

\item[November 2011 - August 2013] \emph{Researcher} - BPM4People Project (\url{http://www.bpm4people.org}): EU-funded research project.
